            A cycle of hardship, right? Inside, we were crying, right? But the one thing we won't give up is the dream we've chosen, right?
        </p>
        <p class="lyrics">
            It's a secondary role, a role in the shadows But in reaching for that dream, let us stay centered, let us stay true.
        </p>
        <p class="lyrics">
            Over and over, we hung on without giving up Over and over, we kept coming back up Over and over, we believed and dreamed Over and over, we've seen fools Over and over
        </p>
        <p class="lyrics">
            Over and over we've stood in the shadows of others
        </p>
        <p class="lyrics">
            Now it's our turn... Let us bask in our dreams
            <br>
            শুভ কামনা , অহনা ।
